These files are to support the exercises in the Refactoring Workbook, by Bill Wake, http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321109295/xp123com 

Each folder contains an exercise. 

These files were updated in January, 2024 to modernize to Java 17-19, get rid of some warning messages,
upgrade to JUnit 5.x, and use Connector/J 8.3.0 for the SQL driver.

Versions are tagged to indicate what language they support, though there's not much difference between them.

If you prefer to work with the original files, they're in rwb-original.zip.

Good luck!
