These files are to support the exercises in the Refactoring Workbook, by Bill Wake, http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321109295/xp123com 

Each folder contains an exercise. 

These files were updated in January, 2024 to modernize to Java 17, get rid of some warning messages, and upgrade to JUnit 5.x.

If you prefer to work with the original files, they're in rwb-original.zip.

Good luck!
