These files are to support the exercises in the Refactoring Workbook, by Bill Wake, http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321109295/xp123com 

Each folder contains an exercise. 

These files were updated in January, 2014 to modernize the Java (e.g., use generics), get rid of warning messages, and use a more modern JUnit style. 

If you prefer to work with the original files, they're in rwb-original.zip.

Good luck!
